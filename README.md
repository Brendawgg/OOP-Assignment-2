# OOP-Assignment-2
Object Oriented Programming Assignment 2 for Aron O'Neill, Brendan O'Dowd and Ryan McGrane. This is a game called Space Escape that we have made with Unity.


The name of our group is ABR Games. Group members are Aron O'Neill , Brendan O’Dowd , and best for last Ryan McGrane. We made a game for our OOP assignment using Unity software. We used Unity Colab to enable each of us to interact and work together as a team efficiently. This means that all our commits throughout the game have been done using the Unity Colab software and not through GitHub. Each team member did their own part of the project, which was decided at an early stage of the year. This gave us a lot of time to think about our game and to come up with creative ideas to make our game as interesting as possible. Our game name is Space Escape and were hoping to publish it in near future.

Ryan McGrane: For this assignment i worked on the Main menu and moon level. Although each member did separate levels we all tied back in at the end to finish all our levels off. Each contributed lots of work for the game, which is shown through the game.

OOP Assignment 2
Space Esacpe
We began working on our assignment early on by going to a room in the basement and doing a plan up on the whiteboard we brainstormed many ideas and a plan was beginning to take place. We has planned to make a game with 4 levels where the player has to escape from each planet and dodge different obstacles and maneuver their way out of danger. We made the first level together playing with unity to sea what was possible and to get a feel for the way to make our game. Then we said that we would use our knowledge and go make a level each with our own themes to give the game a unique feel, I made the Jupiter Level. Each new world we thought of ourselves but we worked together on tricky parts as we came across them. I had a lot of fun making the game and we worked well together as a team and plan on making more games and deploying this one to the app store.
